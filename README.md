The main purpose of this effort is to combine the advantages of [ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/) and Model-Driven-Engineering techniques. This repository holds a family of metamodels defined as Ecore models and their corresponding Xtext-based DSLs (Domain Specific Language) implementation.
The resulted models allow the description of ROS and ROS2 concepts and properties, like packages, artifacts, nodes, interfaces types, parameters... Moreover a complete system as composition of ROS components can be also modelled.

The models have associated tools, the following are some examples:
- Textual editors with grammar highlight, debug functionalities and auto-complete helpers.
- Validators to check the corretness and check the use of best practices
- Code geneators to automatically generate code, documentation, helper scripts...
- (ToBeDone) Graphical editor
